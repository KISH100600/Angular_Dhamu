<p>Desert animals are generally the color of the desert.
    Thus, for instance, the lion, the antelope, and the wild donkey are all sand-colored. <q>Indeed </q>,
    says Canon Tristram,
    in the desert, where neither trees, brushwood, nor even undulation of the surface afford the
    slightest protection to its foes, a modification of color assimilated to that of the surrounding
    country is absolutely necessary. Hence, without exception, the upper plumage of every bird,
    and also the fur of all the smaller
<address>mammals and the skin of all the snakes and lizards</address>,
is of one uniform sand color</p>
